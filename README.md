    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>Picture this, it's 4am and suddenly your bot goes down. Users begin complaining and flooding your support channel. Nobody is online to help.

Status Checker aims to solve this problem. With just a few commands, you can have notifications for your bot setup so that the instant your bot goes offline, your members are aware of it. Custom down messages and automatically publishing them for free.</p>
